# Creating a new list

Please keep the following in mind when creating a new list:
- Test on the latest firmware available for a given device
- Do not include apps that can be disabled/deleted from the application manager.
- Do not include apps that do not come installed by default, _unless_ a system stub app installs the application after
  initial setup.
