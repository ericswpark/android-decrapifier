Here is a collection of pre-populated list of applications for each device.

There is no specific criteria - I just included the apps that I thought were bloatware, like Tripadvisor or Evernote or Facebook, for example. Discontinued apps, like Samsung ChatOn or Google Plus, are also included (even though Google Plus came back as Google Currents that's only for work and as far as I know no company uses it, so it was also included for disabling/removing). If you disagree with my app choices, you are always welcome to make your own! This is just a quick reference point for anyone who just wants to get bloatware off of their phone, fast.
